# Snake-Game
How to Run the Game

Save the above code in a file named snake_game.py.

Ensure you have Pygame installed. If not, install it using:
sh

pip install pygame

Run the game by executing the script:
sh

python snake_game.py

This code sets up a basic snake game where you control the snake using the arrow keys. The game ends if the snake hits the window border or itself, and you can restart or quit the game with the C or Q keys respectively. Enjoy your game!
